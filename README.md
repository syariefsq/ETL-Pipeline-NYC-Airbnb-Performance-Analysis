# 🏙️ NYC Airbnb Listing Performance Analysis — My Data Engineering Journey

## 👋 Hi, I’m Syarief!

Welcome! I built this project to dive deep into the real-world impact of NYC’s Local Law 18 on the Airbnb market. As someone passionate about data engineering and analytics, I wanted to create an end-to-end solution that not only extracts insights from complex data but also tells a compelling story about how regulations shape city life.

## 🌟 What I Learned & Challenges Overcome

- Mastered orchestrating data pipelines with Airflow, including debugging DAG failures and optimizing task dependencies.
- Tackled data quality issues head-on—handling messy, incomplete Airbnb datasets and setting up automated validation checks with Great Expectations.
- Navigated the complexities of integrating PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch via Docker, ensuring a smooth data flow from extraction to visualization.
- Developed actionable insights and visualizations in Kibana, translating raw numbers into clear recommendations.
