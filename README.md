## üèòÔ∏è Problem Background

The short-term rental market in NYC faces significant pressure from the introduction of local law 18, which began enforcement on September 5, 2023. This law requires mandatory registration and the presence of the host for stays under 30 days. As a result, many listings have disappeared, further impacting the short-term rental market and increasing costs for both hosts and travelers.

This project aims to understand the characteristics of successful Airbnb listings in NYC under these new regulations, providing valuable insights for hosts and property managers to adapt their strategies.

## üéØ Objective of the Report/Analysis

The goal is to analyze available rental data to identify which types of properties perform best in the current regulatory environment. This includes examining factors such as review ratings, booking numbers, neighborhood, price, and property features.

Based on this analysis, the report will offer actionable recommendations for hosts and property managers, helping them focus on property types and locations that are more likely to succeed under local law 18.

## üì¶ Project Output

The main output of this project is an end-to-end data pipeline and analysis that extracts, cleans, validates, and loads Airbnb listing data. The results are visualized and summarized to provide practical recommendations for stakeholders in the NYC short-term rental market.

## üìä Data

The analysis uses the Airbnb Open Data dataset from Kaggle, which includes details such as listing ID, host information, neighborhood, coordinates, room type, price, service fees, minimum nights, review counts, last review date, review ratings, and house rules. The dataset features a mix of categorical and numerical columns and contains missing values that are addressed during cleaning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Method

The project employs an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline orchestrated by Apache Airflow for workflow automation and scheduling.

1. **Extract:** Raw data is fetched from a PostgreSQL database (where the original CSV was loaded).
1. **Transform:** Data cleaning is performed using Python and pandas, including removing duplicates, normalizing column names, handling missing values, and converting data types.
1. **Validate:** Data validation is performed using Great Expectations.
1. **Load:** The cleaned data is loaded into a NoSQL database (Elasticsearch).
1. **Visualize & Analyze:** Data is visualized and analyzed using Kibana to generate insights and recommendations.
